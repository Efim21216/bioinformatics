     *                        TM-align (Version 20190822)                     *
     * An algorithm for protein structure alignment and comparison            *
     * Based on statistics:                                                   *
     *       0.0 < TM-score < 0.30, random structural similarity              *
     *       0.5 < TM-score < 1.00, in about the same fold                    *

    Name of Chain_1: A224759                                           
    Name of Chain_2: B224759                                           
    Length of Chain_1:  100 residues
    Length of Chain_2:  100 residues

    Aligned length=  100, RMSD=   0.81, Seq_ID=n_identical/n_aligned= 1.000
    TM-score= 0.95810 (if normalized by length of Chain_1)
    TM-score= 0.95810 (if normalized by length of Chain_2)
    (You should use TM-score normalized by length of the reference protein)

    (":" denotes aligned residue pairs of d < 5.0 A, "." denotes other aligned residues)
